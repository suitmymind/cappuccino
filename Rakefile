    Building with rake is no longer supported, use "jake" instead.

    The commands are all the same (e.g. rake install -> jake install).

    If you do not have jake, you can run sudo ./bootstrap.sh to install it and its dependencies.

    PLEASE remove your Build folder when switching from rake to jake.
