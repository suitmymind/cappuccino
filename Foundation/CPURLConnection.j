    @class CPURLConnection
    @ingroup foundation
    @brief Provides loading of a URL request. 

    An interface to downloading content at a specified URL. Using one of the
    class methods, you can obtain the data.
    
    @delegate -(void)connection:(CPURLConnection)connection didFailWithError:(id)error;
    Called when the connection encounters an error.
    @param connection the connection that had an error
    @param error the error, which is either a javascript DOMException or an http
    status code (javascript number/CPNumber)
    
    @delegate -(void)connection:(CPURLConnection)connection didReceiveResponse:(CPHTTPURLResponse)response;
    Called when the connection receives a response.
    @param connection the connection that received a response
    @param response the received response
    
    @delegate -(void)connection:(CPURLConnection)connection didReceiveData:(CPString)data;
    Called when the connection has received data.
    @param connection the connection that received data
    @param data the received data
    
    @delegate -(void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(CPURLConnection)connection;
    Called when the URL has finished loading.
    @param connection the connection that finished loading
    
    Class Delegate Method:
    
    @delegate -(void)connectionDidReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:(id)connection
    The class delegate allows you to set global behavior for when authentication challenges (401 status codes) are returned.
    
    The recommended way to handle this method is to store a reference to the connection, and then use whatever
    method you have to authenticate yourself.  Once you've authenticated yourself, you should cancel 
    and then start the connection:
    
<pre>
[connection cancel];
[connection start];
</pre>
    
    @param connection the connection that received the authentication challenge.
